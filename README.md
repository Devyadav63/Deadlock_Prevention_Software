# Deadlock_Prevention_Software
This repository focus on code in python, which can detect and prevent deadlocks in your operating system, with the interactive gui

System Monitor & Deadlock Manager
This project is a system monitoring and deadlock management tool designed to detect, prevent, and resolve deadlocks in a system. It provides real-time process monitoring and uses resource allocation techniques like Banker’s Algorithm to determine system safety.

Features:
📊 Process Monitoring: Displays active system processes.

🔍 Deadlock Detection: Identifies resource contention and possible deadlocks.

🛡 Deadlock Prevention: Uses Banker's Algorithm to check if the system is in a safe state.

⚡ Deadlock Recovery: Resolves deadlocks by terminating processes to free resources.

This project aims to enhance system reliability by proactively managing resource allocation. A GUI version is in development for better usability! 🚀
